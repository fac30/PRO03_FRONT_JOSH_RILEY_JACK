**🖥️ Front-End**
The front end of the game is built using React, ensuring a smooth and dynamic user experience. We chose React for its component-based architecture, making the game highly scalable and easy to maintain. In addition to this we also used the syntax of typescript.

**🎨 Design & Prototyping with Figma**
In addition to building the front end with React and styling with Tailwind CSS, we used Figma to design and visualize the layout of the game before development. Figma helped us create a clear representation of the user interface, including map placement, score display, and interactive elements, ensuring a seamless user experience.

**Why Figma?**
Collaborative Design: Figma allowed us to collaborate in real-time, making it easy to share design ideas and get feedback from the team before implementing them in code.

**Key Styling Features**
**Responsive Layout:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile.
**Clean & Minimal Design:** Focus on usability and simplicity.
**Interactive Elements:** Hover effects, button animations, and color transitions to enhance the user experience.
